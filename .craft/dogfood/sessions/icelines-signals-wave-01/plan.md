# Craft Chat Pulse icelines-signals-wave-01

## Mission

Run the first CRAFT-controlled icelines product pulse against WP-010 Signals: inspect current signal surfaces, choose a bounded evidence-backed improvement, validate with native gates, and record structured receipts.

## Lane

rust

## Deliverables

- [ ] task-001: Complete the pulse intent through the selected lane.
- [ ] Record chat status and gate evidence before closeout.
- [ ] Preserve D1 non-claims and avoid unsupported capability promotion.

## Gate Results

- [x] Craft chat pulse plan is descriptor-ready.
- [x] D1 non-claims remain explicit in the Non-goals section.
- [x] `craft chat` is the operator cockpit for this session.

## Post-session gate targets

- `craft chat next --workspace-root <ROOT> --limit 3`
- `craft chat status --workspace-root <ROOT> --limit 3`
- `craft chat continue --workspace-root <ROOT> --limit 3`
- `craft chat summary --workspace-root <ROOT> --output text`
- `craft chat health --workspace-root <ROOT> --output text`
- `craft dogfood pulse gate --workspace-root <ROOT> --session icelines-signals-wave-01`
- `git diff --check`

## Non-goals

No provider or network call, no arbitrary shell wrapper, no autonomous coding
claim, no git commit or PR creation by CRAFT, no full self-hosting claim, and
no `REQ-DOGFOOD-001` verification promotion.
